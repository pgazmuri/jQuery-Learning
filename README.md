jQuery-Learning
===============

Hooray for jQuery, it's the best! Let's track how much we can learn!

**Todos**
=====
- ~~Remove Contact Us / GP - Our DNA / Locations / GP - Contact Us from Business Pages (sub-navs)~~
- ~~Take the links in 1) and only apply them to the Home page (basically give the home page a sub-nav too which contains all these links)~~
- Slider should still only appear on the main page (waiting on JS var)
- Put search bar out of top menu & allow drop-down search from within the top menu
- Each logo (such as GP Cellulose) on each business page should be left aligned and in some situations, such as GP Cellulose and Container Board there should be three flags added which translate the language on the page to whichever is clicked (US, Spanish, Chinese)
- Locations page - take the filter results out of a dropdown and reduce them into a sub-nav similar to the ones seen on other pages. Basically make it a lot prettier and other things.
- As you click on filters, they should be 'active' or at least display some background-color state.
- When clicking on a location, open maps app in phone and redirect them there.
